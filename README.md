# BeatSaverUpdater
Alerts you of updates to maps and updates them to the latest version.

**Features**:
- Shows a button above a map if it is outdated, clicking on it will download an updated version
- Option to delete old map after download and migrate its references (all favourites and non syncable playlists will have the map replaced)

**Important:** 
- This uses a cache of the BeatSaver database (using SongDetailsCache) so map updates won't show up immediately! Don't worry, this isn't a bug, just want to send as few requests to BeatSaver as possible.
- This only accounts for maps that use BeatSaver's update feature and are uploaded on the same key. Reuploads do not count as an updated map.
